# How to run 

There are multiple ways to run the main (best) algorithm -DDPG. The easiest way is to use the jupyter notebook file drl_project_main.ipnyb.
An alternative is available in the main_ddpg.py file.

Some of our most notable deprecated models and tryouts are put for good measure in the deprecated folder.
